(5s cooldown)3000Yordle Duskblade of Draktharr TIPS:This item is best purchased on AD assassins who can attack quickly and decisively after being spotted. The large lethality boost this item provides makes it especially effective against squishy targets like mages or marksmen. The Nightstalker effect allows you to deal significant bonus damage with the first attack on a champion, slowing them briefly, giving you time to follow up with additional attacks. This item excels against targets with low defense, but if the enemy is building more tanky or brawler-oriented champions, you may want to consider a different core item.",
