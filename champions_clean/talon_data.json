Damaging the same target again resets Wound duration. When Talon attacks a target with 3 stack(s) of Wound, all Wound stacks are consumed to send the target into a bleeding state, dealing 80~280 physical damage (80  + 210% bonus ) over 2 second(s).Monsters are dealt 90% of this damage.The target will not gain Wound stacks during this period. If an enemy champion is killed while bleeding, Talon gains bonus Movement Speed that decays over 2 second(s).",
