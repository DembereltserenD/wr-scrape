          "tips": "Soulstealer— This item is perfect for champions who frequently secure kills or assists and want to increase their mobility and ability uptime. It provides bonuses to maximum health, ability power, magic penetration, and ability haste. The \"Wandering Soul\" effect reduces your ability cooldowns by 25% after taking down an enemy champion, and you steal 10% of their base movement speed and 50% of their ability haste until they respawn. The stolen ability haste stacks, making it especially useful for champions who are often involved in kills and want to improve their stats by taking down enemies."
