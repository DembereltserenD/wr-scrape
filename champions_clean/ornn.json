It provides substantial bonuses to armor, mana, and ability haste. The “Winter’s Caress” passive applies up to four stacks of Chill on enemy champions through your basic attacks, abilities, or any magic damage they take—each stack slows their attack speed by 9%, up to 36% at full stacks. This weakens enemy marksmen and fighters, making it harder for them to deal sustained damage in fights."
