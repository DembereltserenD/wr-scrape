This allows you to both absorb damage and heal during skirmishes, making the item an excellent choice for extended fights and closing out teamfights.  Excellent synergy with Spirit Visage: the healing amplification and regeneration boost from Spirit Visage further enhance the health restoration from this item’s passive, providing incredible survivability and sustain in combat.",
